Vim setup
=========
Place the files 'emil.vim' and 'molcasoutput.vim' in your ~/.vim/syntax
directory. Paste the contents of 'molcasvimrc' in your ~/.vimrc.

Syntax coloring will take effect on any file with extension *.input or *.log.
If you do not want this, uncomment the corresponding autocmd line(s).  For the
molcas help feature, pressing K (shift-k) while the cursor is on a keyword in
an input file, a buffer will pop up with the relevant molcas help. Close the
buffer with :q as usual. It works with module names, keywords inside a module,
and  emil commands (if the line begins with >).

Nedit setup
