The dailymerge.plx script can be used to update the Molcas
master and daily-snapshot branches. The system is based on
the existence of so-called 'nickname' branches which are
merged into a daily snapshot. When the snapshot has passed
verification, the master branch is fast-forwarded to that
daily snapshot. When both master and daily-snapshot branch
are the same, all valid nickname branches are merged into
a new snapshot.
