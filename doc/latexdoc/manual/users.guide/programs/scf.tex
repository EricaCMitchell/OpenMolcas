%%+The SCF program of the molcas program system generates
%%+closed-shell Hartree-Fock, open-shell UHF, and Kohn Sham DFT wave functions.
%%%</HELP>

The \program{SCF} program of the \molcas\ program system generates
closed-{}shell Hartree-Fock, open-{}shell UHF, and Kohn Sham DFT wave functions.

The construction of the Fock
matrices is either done conventionally from the two-{}electron integral
file \file{ORDINT},
which was generated in a previous step by the \program{SEWARD}
integral code, or alternatively (only for closed shell calculations)
integral-direct by recomputing all the
two-{}electron integrals when needed \cite{AlmlofFaegriKorsell_DirSCF}.
The later route is recommended for
large basis sets or molecules, when the two-{}electron integral file would
become extensively large. It is automatically taken, when the \program{SCF}
program cannot find any \file{ORDINT} file in the work directory.
The direct Fock matrix construction employs an efficient integral prescreening
scheme, which is based on differential densities
\cite{CremerGauss_SCFprescreening,HaeserAhlrichs_SCFprescreening}: only
those AO integrals are computed, where the estimated contractions with the
related differential density matrix elements give significant (Coulomb or
exchange) contributions to the (differential) two-{}electron part of the Fock
matrix. Integral prescreening is performed at two levels, (i) at the level
of shell quadruples, and (ii) at the level of individual primitive Gaussians.
Prescreening at the level of contracted functions is not supported, because
this would be inefficient in the context of a general contraction scheme.
In order to work with differential density and Fock matrices, a history of
these entities over previous iterations has to be kept. All these matrices
are partly kept in memory, and partly held on disk. The \program{SCF} program
either works with simple differences of the actual and the previous density,
or alternatively with minimized densities, obtained from linear combinations
of the actual density and all the previous minimized densities. \\
Besides the conventional and the fully-direct algorithms there is also a
semi-direct path, which allows for the storage of some of the AO integrals
during the first iteration, which then are retrieved from disk in subsequent
iterations. That path is taken, if the keyword \keyword{DISK} with an
appropriate
argument specifying the amount of AO integrals to store is found on the
input stream. The semi-direct path is recommended for medium sized problems,
where the two-{}electron integral file would become a bit too large (but not
orders of magnitude).

The program contains a feature that allows you to make the
orbitals partially populated during the aufbau procedure.
This feature is not primarily intended to accelerate the convergence
but rather to ensure that you do get convergence in
difficult cases.
The orbitals are populated with with electrons according to
\begin{equation}
\eta_i={{2}\over{1+e^{(\varepsilon_i-\varepsilon_f)/kT}}}
\end{equation}
where
$\varepsilon_i$
is the orbital energy of orbital $i$ and
$\varepsilon_f$
is the Fermi energy.
In this ``Fermi aufbau'' procedure
the temperature is slowly lowered until it reaches a minimum
value and then kept constant until
a stable closed shell configuration is determined.
Then normal SCF iterations will be performed with the selected
closed shell configuration.
For systems that are not really closed shell systems, for example
diradicals, you might end up in the situation that the program
does not find any stable closed shell configuration.
In that case it will continue to optimize the closed shell
energy functional with partial occupation numbers.
If this is the case, this is probably what you want, and such
orbitals would be ideal as starting orbitals for an MCSCF
calculation.

The initial orbital guess is either obtained by diagonalizing the bare nuclei
Hamiltonian, from an initial guess produced by the module \program{Guessorb}
or from orbitals of a previous Hartree-Fock SCF calculation.
These starting orbitals are automatically located in the order
\begin{enumerate}
\item SCF orbitals from a previous calculation located in the \file{RUNFILE}
\item SCF orbitals from a previous calculation located in a formatted orbitals file, \file{INPORB}.
\item initial guess orbitals from module \program{Guessorb} located in the \file{RUNFILE} and
\end{enumerate}
The program has three types of convergence accelerating schemes:
(i) dynamic damping \cite{Karlstroem_SCFdyndumping}, (ii) the C$^2$-DIIS method
using the orbital gradient as error vector \cite{c2-diis}, and (iii)
a combined second-order update/C$^2$-DIIS procedure. The latter eliminates the
Brillouin violating elements of the Fock matrix by proper orbital rotations
and hence avoids diagonalization of the Fock matrix: the approximate inverse
Hessian is updated (BFGS) in a first step, and then the new orbital
displacement vector is obtained from the updated Hessian using C$^2$-DIIS
extrapolation \cite{FischerAlmloef_OrbRot}.
Dynamic damping gives substantial improvements in highly anharmonic
regions of the energy hyper surface, while the second-order
update/C$^2$-DIIS procedure exhibits excellent convergence for less anharmonic
regions. By default, dynamic damping is used during the first few iterations.
When the change in the density between two subsequent iterations drops below
a certain threshold the second-order update/C$^2$-DIIS procedure kicks in.
It is also possible to use the older first order C$^2$-DIIS scheme instead of
the second-order update/C$^2$-DIIS procedure by setting the density threshold
for the latter to zero in the corresponding input card (keyword
\keyword{QNRThreshold}). \\

By default \program{SCF} behaves in different ways depending on what
kind of start orbitals are found according to
\begin{enumerate}
\item No start orbitals are found. In this case the core hamiltonian
  is diagonalized and these orbitals are used as start.
  The ``Fermi aufbau'' procedure is used until a stable configuration is found.
\item Start orbitals from \program{Guessorb} are found.
  In this case the HOMO LUMO gap is analyzed and if it is small
  the ``Fermi aufbau'' procedure is used until a stable configuration is found.
  Otherwise the configuration suggested by \program{Guessorb} is used.
\item Start orbitals from a previous \program{SCF} calculation is found.
  The configuration from the previous \program{SCF} calculation is used,
  unless some problem is detected such as partial occupation numbers
  from an unconverged calculation. In the latter case ``Fermi aufbau'' is used.
\item Start orbitals from an \file{INPORB} is in the same way as for
  start orbitals from an \program{SCF} calculation, see last point.
\end{enumerate}
This behavior can be changed by suitable keywords described below.

One of the main objects of the \program{SCF} program in the context of the
\molcas\ program system is to generate starting
orbitals for subsequent MCSCF calculations.
Two options are available to
improve the canonical Hartree-Fock orbitals in this respect.\\
(i) It is possible to specify pseudo occupation numbers that are neither
zero nor two, thus simulating to some extent an open shell system. The
resulting wavefunction does not have any physical meaning, but will
provide better starting orbitals for open shell systems.\\
(ii) Usually, the lowest virtual canonical Hartree-Fock orbitals are
too diffuse as correlating orbitals in an MCSCF calculation.
If the keyword \keyword{IVO} is encountered in the input stream, the
\program{SCF} program will diagonalize the core Hamiltonian matrix within
the virtual space and write the resulting more compact eigenvectors to the
\file{SCFORB} and \file{RUNFILE} files,
rather than the virtual eigenvectors of the Fock
matrix. It should be noted, that this option must never be used, if the
\program{SCF} wave function itself is used subsequently as a reference
function: no MP2 or coupled cluster calculations after an
\program{SCF} run with \keyword{IVO} ! \\
A further method to generate starting orbitals for MCSCF calculations is
to perform an SCF calculation for a slightly positively charged moiety.


\subsection{Dependencies}
\label{UG:sec:scf_dependencies}
The \program{SCF} program requires the one-{}electron integral file
\file{ONEINT} and the communications file \file{RUNFILE},
which contains among others the
basis set specifications processed by \program{SEWARD}. For conventional
(not integral-direct) runs the two-{}electron integral file \file{ORDINT}
is required as well. All these files are generated by a preceding
\program{SEWARD} run.

used for the Kinetic Energy (available functionals: Thomas-Fermi, with acronym LDTF, and the NDSD functional), and where
fun2 is the xc-functional (LDA, LDA5, PBE and BLYP available at the moment).
The OPTIONAL keyword \keyword{dFMD} has two arguments: first, the fraction of correlation potential to be added to the
OFE potential (zero for KSDFT and one for HF); second, the exponential decay factor for this correction (used in PES calculations).
The OPTIONAL keyword \keyword{FTHA} is used in a freeze-and-thaw cycle (EMIL Do While) to specify the (subsystems) energy convergence threshold.

\subsubsection{Keywords for direct calculations}
{\em Note} again that the threshold for contributions to
the Fock matrix depends on the convergence thresholds
mentioned above. The choice between the conventional and direct SCF
methods is based on the presence of a two-{}electron integral file
(file \file{ORDINT}). The keyword
\keyword{Direct} in the \program{SEWARD} input controls that no
two-{}electron integral file is to be generated and that integral direct
algorithms can be used in subsequent modules. Thus, {\em the
choice between conventional and direct SCF is done already in the input
for the integral program \program{SEWARD}}. The direct (or semi-direct)
path will be taken whenever there are no two-{}electron integrals available.

\begin{keywordlist}

%%+is different from zero it will default to a semi-direct SCF with in-core storage
%%+of the integrals. The size of the memory for integrals storage is the size of the

\subsubsection{Limitations}
The limitations/MODULE on the number of basis functions are the same as specified
for \program{SEWARD}.

\subsubsection{Input examples}

First we have the bare minimum of input. This will work well for almost
all systems containing an even number of electrons.

\begin{inputlisting}
 &SCF
\end{inputlisting}

The next example is almost as simple. Here we have an open shell case,
i.e. you have an odd number of electrons in the neutral system and you
need to generate starting orbitals for \program{RASSCF}.
In this case we recommend that you perform a calculation on the
cation with the input below.

\begin{inputlisting}
 &SCF; Charge= 1
\end{inputlisting}

The next example explains how to run UHF code for a nitrogen atom:
\begin{inputlisting}
 &SCF; UHF; ZSPIN=3
\end{inputlisting}

The next example is a bit more elaborate and show how to use
a few of the keywords. The system is water that have the
electron configuration $\rm 1a_1^2 2a_1^2 3a_1^2 1b_1^2 1b_2^2$.
