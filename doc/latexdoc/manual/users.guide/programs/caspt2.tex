%%Description:
%%%<HELP>
%%+The CASPT2 program is used to compute a dynamic correlation correction to
%%+a RASSCF energy, and optionally to the density matrix and properties.
%%+It can be regarded as a MÃ¸ller-Plesset perturbation method through
%%+second order (MP2), except that is is equally useful for general RASSCF
%%+root functions, also excited states, regardless of symmetry and multiplicity.
%%%</HELP>

Second order multiconfigurational perturbation theory is used in the program
\program{CASPT2}~\cite{Andersson:90,Andersson:92a} to compute the (dynamic)
correlation \index{Perturbation theory!CASPT2} energy. The reference state is
usually of the CAS type, but the program has been extended to also accept
RAS reference states\cite{Malmqvist:2008,Sauri:2011}.
The first step is therefore a RASSCF calculation and the CASPT2
calculation gives a second order estimate of the difference between the RASSCF
and the full CI energy. For calculations using a true RAS reference, benchmark
calculations were reported by Sauri et al.~\cite{Sauri:2011}. For CASSCF
references, the CASPT2 method has been tested in a large number
of applications \cite{Roos:95a,Roos:96b}.  Here follows a brief summary of
results.

\index{CASPT2!Precision}
\index{Bond length!CASPT2}
\index{Bond energy!CASPT2}
\index{Heat of reaction!CASPT2}
Bond distances are normally obtained with an accuracy of better that 0.01
\AA\ for bonds between first and second row atoms. With the standard Fock
matrix formulation, bond energies are normally underestimated with between 2
and 5 kcal/mol for each bond formed. This is due to a systematic error in the
method\cite{Andersson:93a}. In every process where the number of paired
electrons is changed, an error of this size will occur for each electron pair.
For example, the singlet-triplet energy difference in the methylene radical
(CH$_2$) is overestimated with about 3 kcal/mol \cite{Andersson:92a}. Heats of
reactions for isogyric reactions are predicted with an accuracy of $\pm2$
kcal/mol. These results have been obtained with saturated basis sets and all
valence electrons active. The use of smaller basis sets and other types of
active spaces may, of course, affect the error.

These systematic errors have recently been considerably reduced by the
introduction of a modified zeroth order Hamiltonian \cite{Ghigo:04a}. The method
introduces a shift (the IPEA shift) that modifies the energies of active
orbitals such that they become closer to ionization energies when excited from
and closer to electron affinities when excited out of. The approach has been
tested for 49 diatomic molecules, reducing the mean error in D$_0$ from 0.2 to
0.1 eV. For the triply bonded molecules N$_2$, P$_2$, and As$_2$ it was reduced
from 0.45 eV to less than 0.15 eV. Similar improvements were obtained for
excitation and ionization energies. The IPEA modified H$_0$ (with a shift
parameter of 0.25) is default in \molcas\ from version 6.4.

An alternative to IPEA is to use the options, called `$g_1$', `$g_2$', and
`$g_3$'(See Ref.~\cite{Andersson:95a}), that stabilizes the energies of the
active orbitals. The remaining error is no longer systematic, and is generally
reduced. For example, the error in  the singlet-triplet separation of CH$_2$ is
reduced to 1~kcal/mol \cite{Andersson:95a}. This option is, however, not
recommended any longer because it has been replaced by the IPEA Hamiltonian.

The CASPT2 method can be used in any case where a valid reference function can
be obtained with the CASSCF method. There is thus no restriction in the number
of open shells or the spin coupling of the electrons. Excited states can be
treated at the same level as ground states. Actually one of the major
successes with the method has been in the calculation of excitation energies.
A large number of applications have been performed for conjugated organic
molecules. Both Rydberg and valence excited states can be treated and the
\index{Rydberg states!CASPT2}
\index{Excitation energy!CASPT2}
error in computed excitation energies is normally in the range 0.0--0.2 eV.
Similar results have been obtained for ligand field and charge-transfer
excitations in transition metal compounds. From \molcasvi\ it is possible to use
the CASPT2 method in conjunction with the Douglas-Kroll-Hess relativistic
Hamiltonian, which has made possible calculations on heavy element compounds
such a third row transition metal compounds and actinides with accurate results.

The CASPT2 method can also be used in combination with the \program{FFPT}
program to compute dynamic correlation contributions to properties with good
results in most cases.  Numerical gradients are available with the
\program{slapaf} module.

The CASPT2 method is based on second order perturbation theory. To be
successful, the perturbation should be small. A correct selection of
the active space in the preceding CASSCF calculation is therefore of
utmost importance. All near-degeneracy effects leading to configurations
with large weights must be included at this stage of the calculation.
If this is not done, the first order wave function will contain large
coefficients. When this occurs, the \program{CASPT2} program issues a warning.
If the energy contribution from such a configuration is large, the results is
not to be trusted and a new selection of the active space should be made.

Especially in calculations on excited states, intruder states may occur in the
first \index{Intruders!CASPT2} order wave function. Warnings are then issued by
the program that an energy denominator is small or negative. Such intruder
states often arise from Rydberg orbitals, which have not been included in the
active space. Even if this sometimes leads to large first order CI coefficients,
the contribution to the second order energy is usually very small, since the
interaction with the intruding Rydberg state is small. It might then be
safe to neglect the warning. A safer procedure is to include the Rydberg
orbital into the active space. It can sometimes be deleted from the MO space.

Calculations on compounds with heavy atoms (transition metals, actinides, etc)
may yield many virtual orbitals with low energies. The interaction energies for
excitations to states where these orbitals are occupied are often very small and
the low denominators can then be removed by a suitable level shift (see below).
But it is always safer to include such orbitals in the active space.

Two keywords have been introduced to deal with this fairly common
situation, for excited states, that weakly coupled intruders cause
spurious singularities, `spikes' in e.g. a potential curve. The two
keywords \keyword{SHIFT} and \keyword{IMAGINARY SHIFT} (mutually exclusive) will introduce a shift
in the \index{Level shift!CASPT2}\index{Level shift!CASPT2} energy denominators,
thus avoiding singularities, and will also correct the energy for the use of
this shift. The net effect is that the energy is almost unaffected except in
the vicinity of the weak singularity, which is removed. The \keyword{SHIFT} keyword adds
a real shift, and the use of this procedure is well tested
\cite{Roos:95b,Roos:96a}. The \keyword{IMAGINARY SHIFT} adds an imaginary quantity, and
then uses the real value of the resulting second-order energy
\cite{Forsberg:96}. This offers some advantage, in particular for weak intruder
states.

In some cases, where one can expect strong interaction between different CASSCF
wave functions, it is advisable to use the Multi-State (MS) CASPT2 method
\cite{Finley:98b}. A second order effective Hamiltonian is constructed for a
number of CASSCF wave functions obtained in a state-average calculation. This
introduces interaction matrix elements at second order between the different
CASSCF states. The effective Hamiltonian is diagonalized to obtain the final
second order energies. The program also produces a file, \file{JOBMIX}, with the new
effective zeroth order wave functions, which are linear combinations of the
original CASSCF states. This method has been used successfully to separate
artificially mixed valence and Rydberg states and for transition metal compounds
with low lying excited states of the same symmetry as the ground state.

It is clear from the discussion above that it is not a `black box' procedure
to perform CASPT2 calculations on excited states. It is often necessary to
iterate the procedure with modifications of the active space and the selection
of roots in the CASSCF calculation until a stable result is obtained. Normally,
the CASSCF calculations are performed as average calculations over the number
of electronic states of interest, or a larger number of states.
It is imperative that the result is checked
before the CASPT2 calculations are performed. The solutions should contain
the interesting states. If all of them are not there, the number of roots in
the CASSCF calculation has to be increased. Suppose for example, that four
states of a given symmetry are required. Two of them are valence excited states
and two are Rydberg states. A CASSCF calculation is performed as an average
over four roots. Inspection of the solution shows only one valence excited
state, the other three are Rydberg states. After several trials it turns out
that the second valence excited state occurs as root number seven in the
CASSCF calculation. The reason for such a behavior is, of course, the
very different dynamic correlation energies of the valence excited states as
compared to the Rydberg states. It is important that the AO basis set is
chosen to contain a good representation of the Rydberg orbitals, in order to
separate them from the valence excited states. For more details on how to
perform calculations on excited states we refer to the
literature \cite{Roos:95b,Roos:96a} and section~\ref{TUT:sec:excited} of
the examples manual.

The first order wave function is obtained in the \program{CASPT2} program as an
iterative solution to a large set of linear equations. The size of the
equation system is approximately $n^2*m^2/2$ where $n$ is the sum of inactive
and active orbitals and $m$ is the sum of active and secondary orbitals.
Symmetry will reduce the size with approximately a factor $g_{\rm sym}$, the
number of irreps of the point group.

\program{CASPT2} produces a set of molecular orbitals that can be used
\index{Orbitals!CASPT2}\index{CASPT2!Orbitals}
as start orbitals for other programs or further calculations.
A minimal CASSCF and CASPT2 gives orbitals and occupation numbers
which can be used to design a proper larger calculation.
By default, the orbitals are natural orbitals obtained from the
density matrix of the (normalized) wave function through first order.
However, the active/active block of that density matrix is not computed
exactly. An approximation has been designed in such a way that the trace
is correct, and the natural occupation numbers of active orbitals are
between zero and two. Due to the approximation, any properties computed
using these orbitals are inexact and can be used only qualitatively. An exact
first order density matrix can be computed but this is more time-consuming. It
is controlled by the keyword \keyword{DENSity}. Use this keyword to compute
properties like dipole moments, etc. The most secure accurate way to do that is.
however, to use finite field perturbation theory (FFPT).

This keyword is used to select atoms for defining the correlation orbital
space for the CASPT2 calculation. Assume that you have a large molecule where
the activity takes place in a limited region (the active site). It could be a
metal atom with its surrounding ligands. You can then use this option to reduce
the size of the CASPT2 calculation by freezing and deleting orbitals that have
only a small population in the active site. An example: The cobalt imido complex
Co$^{III}$(nacnac)(NPh) has 43 atoms. The active site was cobalt and the
surrounding ligand atoms. Using the AFRE option reduces the time for the CASPT2
calculation from 3 hrs to 3 min with a loss of accuracy in relative energies for
24 electronic states of less than 0.1 eV. The first line after the keyword
contains the number of selected atoms then the selection thresholds (the
recommended value is 0.1 or less). An additional line gives the names of the
atoms as defined in the Seward input. Here is a sample input for the cobalt
complex mentioned above.
